### 📦 DropBox setup
Setting up Dropbox on Koreader can be a little bit difficult. 
[This excellent post on mobileread forum](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=353670) explains the procedure in detail.

## Details
AnnotationSync stores its files directly in the selected cloud storage
directory, so you may want to create a new directory dedicated to AnnotationSync.
By using the default settings (i.e. "Use filename instead of hash" unchecked) the sync files are named according to a hash of the document being synced, so it
will look something like this:

```
.
..
330209864aecdf8cc63a16022f6a30f8.json
dda324e17e50f6c8c4c481ee4fcb1aa4.json
```

There is currently no other identifying information about the original document name stored in either the
filesystem or the contents of the files.

If you prefer to use the filename instead of an hash of the content just check the box under:
Tools -> AnnotationSync -> Settings -> Use filename instead of hash
By doing so the filename on every device should be the same.
This option should be chosen by users that change file metadata (e.g. with Calibre) otherwise the hash would change everytime you make any modification.
