## Details
AnnotationSync stores its files directly in the selected cloud storage
directory, so you may want to create a new directory dedicated to AnnotationSync.
The sync files are named according to a hash of the document being synced, so it
will look something like this:

```
.
..
330209864aecdf8cc63a16022f6a30f8.json
dda324e17e50f6c8c4c481ee4fcb1aa4.json
```

There is currently no other identifying information about the original document name stored in either the
filesystem or the contents of the files.

## 📄 Known Issues
- Binding the "Annotation Sync: Manual Sync" action to a profile with "Auto-execute -> on book closing" will cause KOReader to crash.
- ~~At the moment intersections between highlights spanning different
epub blocks may not be detected.~~ Fixed in [4ae7868](https://github.com/dani84bs/AnnotationSync.koplugin/commit/4ae7868057991f57ab2d7ff865d1201ebfd5e53e)
